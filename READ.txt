This script creates a simple desktop AI assistant with a graphical interface using PySimpleGUI and LangChain (OpenAI GPT).

✅ Two tools are built in:

A calculator for basic addition.

A greeting tool to say hello.

🧠 The assistant uses LangChain's ReAct agent framework to choose between tools or just reply naturally.

💬 The interface includes:

A multiline chat display for conversation history.

An input field for user messages.

Send and Quit buttons, with Enter bound to Send.

⚙️ A background thread handles the AI responses to prevent the GUI from freezing.

🔐 The OpenAI API key is loaded from a .env file.
